5 	3 	47 	53 	+32 53 	60 	5 	Indefinite; elongated NE and SW; Eta Persei (mag 5.8) near NE side 	60 	Perseus
6 	3 	56 	23 	+56 7 	  	4 	Round; indefinite 	28 	Camelopardalis
7 	4 	17 	25 	+28 33 	  	5 	Large, irregular, with brighter condensation (B 10) in SE part 	78 	Taurus
8 	4 	17 	50 	+55 14 	  	? 	Center of a dark, irregular lane about 2.6 degrees long and 22' + or - across; very much like the dark lanes E. of Rho Ophiuchi 	28 3 	Camelopardalis
9 	4 	18 	  	+55 3 	  	? 	Dark, irregular vacancy. This is the middle of a great vacancy extending east and west, the continuous part of which is 2.5 degrees long and about .5 degree wide. It really extends in a more or less broken form for about 6 degrees. There is a wide region extending south of it for a couple of degrees, nearly to the star BD +53 750 (magnitude 5.0) whose position is 4h6m58s, N 53 18' (1875.0). To the east it breaks up into more or less separate spots, somewhat resembling those at the east end of the great lane from Rho Ophiuchi, but unlike that lane it does not originate in a larger vacant space or a nebula. Its borders are not so definite as the Rho Ophiuchi lane. It is approximately bounded by the coordinates 3h58m, N54.7 and 4h20m, N54.8. The individual positions of some of the spots are given in the catalogue. 	28 	Camelopardalis
10 	4 	18 	41 	+28 16 	8 	5 	The brightest part of B 7 	78 	Taurus
11 	4 	26 	37 	+55 2 	  	3 	East end of irregular lane, B 8 	28 	Camelopardalis
12 	4 	29 	47 	+54 14 	24 	5 	Isolated dark spot SE of B 11; irregularly round with extension E. from the NE side 	28 	Camelopardalis
13 	4 	31 	18 	+54 53 	11 	4 	Irregular; irregularly darker inside with a rather sharp, short, narrow extension toward the S. 	28 	Camelopardalis
14 	4 	39 	59 	+25 44 	3 	? 	Very small, bright nebula; a bright spot in the dark nebula B 22. (Position given in Astrophysical Journal, 49:14, (1919ApJ.49.1B) in error by 10m in right ascension.) 	78 	Taurus
15 	4 	31 	56 	+46 37 	13 	5 	Elliptical; diameter 15' x 10' slightly NW and SE. One of the finest examples of a dark object seen against the ordinary sky and away from the Milky Way. The background on which the stars shine is uniform over the entire plate. The object is in a region somewhat larger than itself, where there are relatively few stars, and is black by contrast with the sky alone. It clearly shows the presence of a feeble uniform luminosity in space which, from the appearance of similar objects in widely different parts of the sky, leads to the belief that this feeble illumination of distant space is universal. If this object were seen against the star clouds of the Milky Way it would appear strikingly black. 	42 	Perseus
16 	4 	32 	26 	+46 36 	  	5 	Very small; elongated N and S; close to SE edge of B 15 	42 	Perseus
17 	4 	32 	30 	+46 31 	  	5 	Very small; elongated N and S; close to E edge of B 15 	42 	Perseus
18 	4 	31 	13 	+24 21 	60 	5 	Group of dark spots 	78 	Taurus
19 	4 	33 	  	+26 16 	60 	? 	Large, indefinite 	78 	Taurus
20 	4 	37 	4 	+50 58 	60 	2 	In S part of larger, relatively vacant area; this is the dark object mentioned by Espin in Monthly Notices, 58, 334, (1898MNRAS..58..334E). It is close north of a small group of faint stars and is 6' or 8' in diameter. In a somewhat larger vacant space (sic). It is not so definite as B 15. 	42 	Perseus
21 	4 	37 	57 	+55 21 	10 	4 	Indefinite; irregularly round 	28 	Camelopardalis
22 	4 	38 	  	+26 3 	120 	4 	Irregular; unequally dark; extended SE and NW; this is a very large region of obscure nebulosity with several darker streaks in it trending northwest. It is partly separated from another starless region lying about 2 degrees to the west and north. Near the middle of the first of these regions is a small luminous nebula with a faint fan-shaped extension for 10' to the northeast (B 14). This is undoubtedly a brighter condensation of the great obscuring mass surrounding it. The position of this small nebula is 4h32m20s, N25 30' (1875.0). 	78 	Taurus
23 	4 	40 	33 	+29 52 	5 	5 	Sharply pointed to the SE; BD +29 728 (magnitude 6.5) in N part 	59 	Taurus
24 	4 	42 	53 	+29 44 	8 	5 	Sharply pointed to the S 	59 	Taurus
25 	4 	52 	4 	+46 0 	8 	3 	Irregularly round; a good example of a dark or more or less starless region. 	42 	Auriga
26 	4 	54 	38 	+30 37 	5 	6 	Irregular; B 26, 27, 28 are close NW of BD +30 741 (mag 6.8), which is involved in feeble nebulosity 	59 	Auriga
27 	4 	55 	8 	+30 33 	5 	6 	Irregular 	59 	Auriga
28 	4 	55 	52 	+30 38 	4 	6 	Irregular 	59 	Auriga
29 	5 	6 	23 	+31 35 	10 	6 	Round; indefinite 	59 	Auriga
30 	5 	30 	16 	+12 46 	67 	4 	Large dark area with few stars. There is a nebulous border, .5 degree wide, to the semi-vacant region extending 1 degree east and north from BD +12 803 (magnitude 7.0). Apparently this nebulous border extends many degrees east in a very diffused manner. There is a narrow dark lane extending south from the semi-vacant region, running close west of BD +12 803 to a point nearly 1 degree south of BD +12 801 (mag 6.9). There is a small fan-shaped nebula close north of small star in the position 5h24m30s, +12 3.9' (1875.0). A small strip of nebulosity extends 5' southwest from this star. These two nebulae are probably the brighter parts of a large obscure nebulosity. 	96 	Orion
31 	5 	32 	1 	+12 45 	30 	4 	Extended NE and SW; the E. and darkest part of B 30 	96 	Orion
32 	5 	32 	8 	+12 25 	  	3 	Dark projection from S. end of B 31 to the E. 	96 	Orion
33 	5 	40 	52 	- 2 27 	4 	4 	Dark mass, on nebulous strip extending S from Zeta Orionis (see Astrophysical Journal, 38, 500, (1913ApJ....38..496B), and Plate XX) 	116 	Orion
34 	5 	43 	30 	+32 38 	20 	4 	Round; starless; indefinite 	59 	Auriga
35 	5 	45 	30 	+ 9 3 	15 	2 	Elongated E and W, 20'x10', with an extension SE; three small stars N of it. 	96 	Orion
36 	5 	49 	  	+ 7 25 	120 	4 	Irregular, narrow dark lane, NE and SW. The NE end connects brokenly with B 35. Well shown on Plate 21, Lick Observatory Publications, 11, 1913. 	96 	Orion
37 	6 	32 		+10 28 	175 	4 	Irregular, semi-vacant region. This region is abruptly terminated on the S side by the nebulosity extending north from 15 Monocerotis. Its west side ends abruptly at 6h22m15s, +12 26' (1875.0). B 37, 38, and 39 are shown in Plates 28 and 29, Lick Observatory Publications, 11, 1913. 	96 	Monocerus
38 	6 	33 	41 	+11 4 	60 	4 	Irregular vacancy. This seems to refer to a portion of B 37. 	96 	Monocerus
39 	6 	38 	2 	+10 19 	  	5 	Small, sharply defined, elongated spot in the nebulosity NW of 15 Monocerotis. 	96 	Monocerus
40 	16 	14 	38 	-18 58 	15 	3 	Diffused dark spot; small star in it. This spot and B 41 are connected with the great nebula about Nu Scorpii and are doubtless denser opaque masses of the nebula. There is a larger dark region belonging to this same system in B 43, from which broken dark lanes somewhat like those from Rho Ophiuchi, though less marked, run eastward for some degrees. 	147 	Scorpius
41 	16 	22 	17 	-19 37 	45 	3 	Diffused dark spot 	147 	Scorpius
42 	16 	25 		-23 26 		6 	Great nebula of Mu Ophiuchi; this object is put in the list because, though not wholly dark, it is partly so, and the evident obscuration produced by it puts it in the class for which the catalogue is made. The semi-vacant region in which this, the great nebula of Rho Ophiuchi, lies is about 3.5 degrees in diameter. For references to the visual discovery and early observations of this strange region see Astronomische Nachrichten, 138, 211, 1895; Popular Astronomy 5, 227, 1897; 14, 581, 1906; Lick Observatory Publications, 11, 19, 1913 and Plate 36. 	147 	Ophiuchus
43 	16 	30 	  	-19 46 	  	4 	Large dark region 	147 	Ophiuchus
44 	16 	40 		-24 4 		5 	Dark lane E. from Rho Ophiuchi region. This is the middle of the main part of the great vacant lane that runs east from the region of Rho Ophiuchi. It is about 32' wide and has its beginning in a vacant area in which is the star 22 Scorpii (CD -24 12695, magnitude 5.5). It runs slightly northeast to about 16h40m, -23 40' (1875.0). From this point it extends in a broken chain of dark spots to a little south of B 63. Its total length is therefore about 10 degrees. 	147 	Ophiuchus
#44a 	16 	44 	45 	-40 20 	5 	5 	Irregular; sharpest on SE side; CD -40 10662 (mag 9.0) close N. Apparently a real dark object. 	164 	Scorpius
45 	16 	46 	  	-21 35 	120 	5 	Rather definite; Extended NE and SW with an irregular projection SW that connects it with the Rho Ophiuchi region. This appears to be a real, dark object. 	146 	Ophiuchus
46 	16 	57 	12 	-22 43 	  	6 	Irregular; definite; a string of small stars in the middle. 	146 	Ophiuchus
47 	16 	59 	42 	-22 38 	15 	5 	Irregular; definite; connected with B 51 by two sharp lanes. 	146 	Ophiuchus
48 	17 	1 	  	-40 41 	40 	5 	Fairly well defined; 15' W and N of CD -40 11088 (magnitude 8); seems to be a real object. 	164 	Scorpius
49 	17 	2 	39 	-33 16 	  	3 	Small; close SE of and involving CD -33 11668 (magnitude 9.3). 	164 	Scorpius
50 	17 	2 	54 	-34 23 	15 	6 	Large, irregular dark space; this is an irregular square, sharply defined on the east side and diffused on the west, where there are broken extensions for 30'. The star CD -34 11418 (magnitude 9.8) is near the middle. The stars CD -34 11422 (magnitude 9.8) and -34 11427 (magnitude 9.9) are on the eastern border. 	164 	Scorpius
51 	17 	4 	44 	-22 15 	20 	6 	Definite; one of a straggling group toward the eastern end of the dark lane from Rho Ophiuchi. Two irregular, dark lanes run west from it to B 47. 	146 	Ophiuchus
53 	17 	6 	  	-33 35 	60 	4 	Large; diffuse; extended N and S by 30'; curved toward the E at N end. 	164 	Scorpius
54 	17 	6 	34 	-34 15 	5 	5 	Small; round; close S. of magnitude 11 star 	164 	Scorpius
55 	17 	7 	33 	-32 0 	16 	5 	Irregular; best defined SE.; CD -31 13582 (magnitude 8.9) near the center. 	164 	Scorpius
56 	17 	8 	48 	-32 5 	3 	5 	Small; close E of CD -31 13609 (magnitude 9.0). This seems to be a real object. 	164 	Scorpius
57 	17 	8 	22 	-22 49 	5 	6 	Elongated NE and SW 	146 	Ophiuchus
58 	17 	11 	12 	-40 24 	30 	6 	Slightly extended N and S; a darker core at NE side 	164 	Scorpius
59 	17 	11 	23 	-27 29 	60 	5 	Sink hole; at the W end of a wide broken lane from B 78 	146 	Ophiuchus
60 	17 	11 	51 	-22 26 	13 	3 	Curved; extended NE and SW; this and B 57 are the most distinct of a group of dark spots SW of the square end of B 63. 	146 	Ophiuchus
61 	17 	14 	59 	-20 28 	  	6 	Small; elongated E and W 	146 	Ophiuchus
62 	17 	16 	12 	-20 52 	19 	6 	Very black in NW part; brightest of three stars in S part is BD -20 4690 (magnitude 9.4). Apparently a real object. 	146 	Ophiuchus
63 	17 	16 	  	-21 28 	60 	3 	Large, definite, curved figure, convex to N; the W end abrupt; 97' E and W, 19' wide 	146 	Ophiuchus
64 	17 	17 	18 	-18 29 		6 	Cometary; W of M 9; This object is somewhat cometary in form and has a very black core or head that sharply abuts against the thick stratum of stars; from this it spreads out into a large dark area with much dark detail, filling quite a space close southwest of M 9. It thus resembles a dark comet with a dense and well-defined head and diffused widening tail. The position of the head is 17h9m57s, -18 20.6 (1875.0). 	146 	Ophiuchus
65 	17 	19 	36 	-26 42 	12 	6 	Definite; elongated; 12' E and W 	146 	Ophiuchus

70 	17 	23 	32 	-24 2 	4 	4 	Sharply defined on W side 	146 	Ophiuchus
71 	17 	23 	2 	-24 0 	1 	? 	Very small; extends 1.25', plus or minus 	146 	Ophiuchus
72 	17 	23 	35 	-23 37 		6 	S-shaped; this is a striking object. It is a thin, curved black marking, the exact form of the letter S or the figure 5, as the imagination or point of view may dictate. The SE branch runs E for some distance passing close S of the star CD -23 13376 (magnitude 9.1). Its average thickness is about 2'-3'. The position in the catalogue is for the southern part of the figure, or the bottom of the S (see Astrophysical Journal, 49, (1919ApJ....49....1B), Plate III). 	146 	Ophiuchus
73 	17 	24 	8 	-24 17 	1 	? 	Very small; extended N and S 4' 	146 	Ophiuchus
74 	17 	25 	8 	-24 12 	  	5 	Slightly curved, extending 5' N from CD -24 13325 (magnitude 7.1). Sharpest on W and S sides. 	146 	Ophiuchus
75 	17 	25 	17 	-22 1 	  	5 	Curved and scalloped marking; BD -21 4598 (magnitude 8.3) on N edge (see Astrophysical Journal, 49, Plate II, 1(1919ApJ....49....1B) 	146 	Ophiuchus
76 	17 	25 		-24 24 		4 	Irregular, narrow black strip, 30' long E and W 	146 	Ophiuchus
77 	17 	28 	  	-23 51 	60 	3 	Indefinite; connected by a vacant strip with B 78 	146 	Ophiuchus
78 	17 	32 		-25 35 	180 	5 	Very large; CD -26 12152 (magnitude 6.2) S of the middle. This vacant region, with its extension to the west running south of Theta Ophiuchi, is visible to the naked eye (see Popular Astronomy, 14, 580, 1906.) 	146 	Ophiuchus
79 	17 	37 	23 	-19 36 	30 	6 	30' long SE and NW; narrow; sharply defined 	146 	Ophiuchus
80 	17 	37 	42 	-21 16 	2 	3 	Small, definite; 3' x 1', SW and NE; close SE of BD -21 4674 (magnitude 80 8.1). 	146 	Ophiuchus
81 	17 	38 	32 	-23 55 	  	? 	Very small; diffused; close SW of NGC 6401 	146 	Ophiuchus
82 	17 	38 	37 	-23 46 	  	3 	Small; angular; well defined; 8' N of NGC 6401 	146 	Ophiuchus
83 	17 	45 	18 	-20 0 	7 	6 	Irregular; several small stars in it; narrow extension to the S 	146 	Ophiuchus
#83a 	17 	38 	58 	-24 10 	4 	6 	Small; definite; diam. 4', N and S; about 5' SE of BD -19 4698 (magnitude 9.5) 	146 	Ophiuchus

85 	18 	2 	25 	-23 1 	  	? 	Trifid nebula. This is the southern part of the Trifid nebula, NGC 6514. The dark markings in this nebula are too well known to insert in this catalogue. 	146 	Sagittarius
86 	18 	3 	1 	-27 52 	5 	5 	Diam. 5'; edge of diffused nebulosity. For the visual discovery of this object see Astronomische Nachrichten 108, 370, 1884. 	146 	Sagittarius
87 	18 	4 	10 	-32 29 	  	4 	"Parrot's head"; CD -3 13679 (magnitude 9.3) central; several smaller stars in it CD -32 13666 (magnitude 9.6) on NW edge. CD -32 13687 (9.6) on SE edge. 	163 	Sagittarius
88 	18 	4 	35 	-24 6 	2 	? 	Extended N and S; 2.7'x0.5'; in M8. There are other well-known markings in this nebula. This one and B 89 are given as illustrations of dark markings in the sky shown in relief against a nebulous or other luminous background. In this case there may be non-luminous opaque parts of the nebula itself. 	145 	Sagittarius
89 	18 	4 	59 	-24 21 	0.5 	? 	Very small, diam. 0.5'; in M8 	145 	Sagittarius

In Monthly Notices, 69 (1908MNRAS..69..117W), Dr. Max Wolf gives a photograph of the nebula, stating that the object was discovered by Dr. Kopff at Heidelberg on October 12, 1908. It is conspicuous on a photograph of mine made with the Willard lens at the Lick Observatory, September 24, 1895, with 5h0m exposure. It is also shown on a photograph of mine made with the Bruce telescope, July 20, 1904, with an exposure of 3h1m. By inadvertence reference to this object was omitted in Lick Observatory Publications, 11, where it is cut out by the matting in Plate 83. 	9 3 	Cepheus
